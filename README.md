# daily-ui-challenges

This is where i will upload my #dailyui challenges. I will also make a portfolio site which will contain all of the challenges on a website and when you click each it will show a live working version of the UI design.

This will be a great project to develop my design skills, while also being able to build it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Daily UI 001:

Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.
